#Midterm 1 Project

This project is designed to compare two different methods of computing pi.

One method uses the Leibniz series and the other uses the Bailey-Borwein-Plouffe series.
This program compares the length of time required to compute as well as the number of terms
required in order to obtain a certain accuracy.
